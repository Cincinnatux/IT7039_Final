# IT7039_Final
Final project for IT7039 Python: Graduate Topics in IT
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to configure, deploy, and modify a Flask web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, allowing public access to your app from the internet. This assignment will also require minor modifications to showcase your understanding of file structure and basic web development principles. 

Assignment Requirements: 

1. Background Color Change: 
  Modify the CSS file to change the html body background color to rgb(105, 112, 97) 
  This change demonstrates your understanding of CSS and how it affects the app's appearance. 

2. Create a Landing Page: 
  Develop a home or landing page in using app.route(‘/’).  This page includes two links: 
    Link 1 should direct users to the Task Master Project on your server. 
    Link 2 is a placeholder that will eventually link to your final project  
    Add a Go Back to Homepage Link on your assignment's index.html page. 

3. Adjust File Structure: 
  Since the landing page uses the root route (‘/’), move all the pages of Task Master project to one level deeper, such as “assignment” directory. For example, the original ‘/’ route will become ‘/assignment/ route.  
  This step shows your understanding of organizing files and directories within a web application. 

Submission Guidelines: 
    Submit the FULL URL of your AWS domain name (not the public IP) of your landing page. For example:  http://Your_AWS_Instance_Domain_Name:Port_Number 
    Links to an external site.  
    Test your web application and verify that the URL is accessible from the internet. 
    Ensure all required modifications are visible and functional before submitting. 
We will evaluate your assignment by accessing your landing page and reviewing the app  to verify modifications and deployment. This page will be used for your final project as well.
